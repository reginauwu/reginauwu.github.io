            <center>  - February 1997: Hamburger Kunsthalle announced that Extension, a competition for net art will be held as a virtual extension of the museum </center>
            <center> - Theme of competition: Internet as material and Object </center>
            <center> - Artists can upload up to 5 megabytes of data to a server for review by jury </center>
            <center> - Response: Cornelia Sollfrank generated an estimate of about three hundred fake female artists, and remixed existing websites to create “data trash,” </center>
            <center> - Each female artist has complete addresses with phone numbers, but also working email accounts on a number of different servers </center>
            <center> - Method: Used a computer program that collected HTML-material with search engines on the World Wide Web and recombined this data automatically to create a <a href="https://nag.iap.de/"> net art generator </a> </center>
            <center> - Purpose: Raise questions about net art’s relationship to the institution </center>
            <center> - Thinks that “Net art has nothing to do with museums and their operations, their juries and prizes, because it goes against the nature of Net art. </center>
            <center>  Net art is simply on the Net; so there's no reason for a museum or for a jury that decides what the best Net art is.”</center>
            <center> - Result: 120 MegaByte of net art submitted with identities created from Germany, Netherlands, US, Slovenia and Austria</center>
            <center> - Although two-thirds of the participants were women, all the winners were men </center>
