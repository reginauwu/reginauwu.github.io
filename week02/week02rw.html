        <h3> notes from ways of seeing: </h3>
        <p> - introduction to cameras gave a new meaning to paintings through manipulation of movement and sound</p>
        <p> - art can now be used by anybody for their own purpose (like memes) </p>
        <p> - being naked becomes a form of "uniform" and "garment"- a way for woman to look and act (objectification) </p>
        <p> - oil paintings where the medium where the rich displayed just how rich they were </p>
        <p> - publicity takes on a new turn over old tradition where a life and dream is being sold rather than being already owned</p>
        <p> - "Oil paintings were surrounded by gold frames which symbolised the wealth around the owner within the picture and around it. 
            What surrounds the publicity image is us, as we are." - John Berger </p>
